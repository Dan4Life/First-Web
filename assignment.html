    <!--This is Question two-->
    <p>This is going to be a really long paragraph with 200 words. If I know how to count correctly, the number of words in this paragraph is currently at 29 words. 
    <br>This is still too small for a 200-word paragraph so I’m going to continue typing until the number of word reaches exactly 200 words. 
        While, we’re at it, let's<br>talk about myself. My name is Daniel Emeka – Ilozor. I am 16 years old and started programming roughly 5 years ago. 
        I want to become a full stack <br>developer as it’s a very interesting job and hope to become good at it. 
        I actually do competitive programming, although it is frowned upon a bit by some <br>professional programmers, 
        due to bad habits that could be formed like using standard namespace in C++. There was even a case study that people that were <br>good in competitive programming 
        tend to be bad at software programming in Google. This case study was later overturned as the author was basically <br>cherry-picking and there weren’t enough cases to prove his point. 
        The truth is competitive programming is actually a good way to start your software <br>programming journey but my 200 words is actually up. Bye! </p>

        the roles they play in <s>small</s> large-scale social and information <small>systems</small>, and their <del>broader</del> <ins>extensive</ins>
        societal implications. My work has been supported by an NSF Career Award <sup>Important Award</sup>, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, 
        a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, 
        and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of
