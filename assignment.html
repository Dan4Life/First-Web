    <!--This is Question two-->
    <p> This is going to be a really long paragraph with 200 words. If I know how to count correctly, the number of words in this paragraph is currently at 29 words. 
        This is still too small for a 200-word paragraph so I’m going to continue typing until the number of word reaches exactly 200 words. 
        While, we’re at it, let's talk about myself. My name is Daniel Emeka – Ilozor. I am 16 years old and started programming roughly 5 years ago. 
        I want to become a full stack developer as it’s a very interesting job and hope to become good at it. 
        I actually do competitive programming, although it is frowned upon a bit by some professional programmers, 
        due to bad habits that could be formed like using standard namespace in C++. There was even a case study that people that were good in competitive programming 
        tend to be bad at software programming in Google. This case study was later overturned as the author was basically cherry-picking and there weren’t enough cases to prove his point. 
        The truth is competitive programming is actually a good way to start your software programming journey but my 200 words is actually up. Bye! </p>
